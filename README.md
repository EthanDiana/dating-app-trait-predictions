# Dating App Trait Preferences

This repository contains a data science project that analyzes and predicts the traits most valued by dating app users. The project utilizes machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks, to identify key factors that influence the likelihood of a user receiving matches on a dating app.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop predictive models that estimate the number of matches a dating app user might receive based on demographic and personal characteristics. The analysis focuses on traits such as:

- Age
- Gender
- Income
- Number of children
- Attractiveness level
- VIP status on the app

By understanding these factors, the project aims to provide insights that could improve the matching algorithms of dating apps, leading to better user experiences and higher satisfaction.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `CODE_MAIN_EXPERIMENT.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook file used for the primary data analysis and model development.
- `CODE_GENDER_SPLIT_EXPERIMENT.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook file used for analyzing the data with a focus on gender-specific traits.
- `DATASET.csv`: The CSV file containing the dataset used in this project.
- `Final Report.pdf`: The LaTeX report as a PDF that documents the methodology, results, and conclusions of the project.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, including instructions on how to use the repository.

## Getting Started

To explore or reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dating-app-trait-preferences.git
   cd dating-app-trait-preferences
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the notebooks directly in the repository to explore the analysis.

## Project Details

### Data Preparation

The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/predict-online-dating-matches-dataset) and includes information on user demographics and personal traits. The data was preprocessed by handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.

### Models Used

- **Logistic Regression**: Used for its simplicity and interpretability.
- **Random Forest**: Chosen for its robustness and ability to handle nonlinear relationships.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
- **Neural Networks**: Captures complex patterns in data.

### Evaluation

The models were evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared (RÂ²), Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. The Random Forest model performed best overall.

## Results

The analysis revealed that **attractiveness** and **gender** are the most influential factors in determining the number of matches a user receives. These findings could help improve dating app algorithms by focusing on the traits that matter most to users.
